# Line Follower

This repository is dedicated to the Line Follower project made during the Introduction to Robotics course. I worked with [@CilteaIoana](https://github.com/CilteaIoana/LineFollower) and [@surtexx](https://github.com/surtexx/LineFollower) 

The chassis was made by us using a foam board and we connected the components using screws and zip-ties.

The goal is to create a car that follows the black line to complete the route in the shortest possible time.
 

  ### Components: 
      Arduino Uno Mini
      Zip-ties
      Power source (LiPo battery)
      2 wheels
      wires for the line sensor (female - male)
      Ball caster
      QTR-8A reflectance sensor , along with screws
      Chassis
      2 mini breadboards
      L293D motor driver
      2 DC motors
